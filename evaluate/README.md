# Evaluate
This folder contains two notebooks to evaluate:
* Alanine dipeptide ([notebook](./evaluate_ala2.ipynb))
* Fast folders ([notebook](./evaluate_fastfolders.ipynb))

These notebooks use [evaluators](./evaluators.py) that are also provided in this folder.

Moreover, we provide the [Langevin dynamics sampling commands](./sampling_commands.md) we used to obtain the results reported in the [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00702).
